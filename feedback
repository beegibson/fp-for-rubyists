TCO explanation

questions:
Is it hard and not worth doing in ruby
What's a monad

and benefit from each on their own
got stuff like map and filter

denigned with option in mind
with more immutable in standard library, moving that way
eg frozen primitives

how to apply functional to make ruby better, and apply the tools of...

Remove how to teach, and talk about how ruby is moving in that way
